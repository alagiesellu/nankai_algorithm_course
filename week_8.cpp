    ■ Greedy Mouse

    ■ Description
    A fat mouse prepared 𝑀 pounds of cat food, and was ready to trade with the cats guarding the warehouse
    containing his favorite food : peanut. The warehouse has 𝑁 rooms. The 𝑖th room contains 𝑊[𝑖] pounds of
    peanut and requires 𝐹[𝑖] pounds of cat food. The fat mouse does not have to trade for all the peanut in
    the room, instead, he may get 𝑊[𝑖]∗𝑎%pounds of peanut if he pays 𝐹[𝑖]∗ 𝑎%pounds of cat food.
    The mouse is a greedy mouse, so can you tell him the maximum amount of peanut he can obtain?

    ■ Input
    – The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two non-negative
    integers 𝑀 and 𝑁. Then 𝑁 lines follow, each contains two non-negative integers 𝑊[𝑖] and 𝐹[𝑖], respectively.
    The test case is terminated by two -1. All integers are not greater than 1000.

    ■ Output
    – For each test case, print in a single line a real number with up to three decimal places, which is the maximum
    amount of peanut that the fat mouse can obtain.
