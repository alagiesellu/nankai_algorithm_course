/** Exercise 5
 *
    ■ Maximum Subarray

    ■ Description
        – Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
        – A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
        – If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

    ■ Input
        – The first line of the input is an integer n, which is the length of array.
        – Each of the next n lines contains a single integer in the array.

    ■ Output
        – The largest sum of the contiguous subarray.
