    ‚ñ† Repair the Wall

    ‚ñ† Description
    Long time ago , Kitty lived in a small village. The air was fresh and the scenery was very beautiful.
    The only thing that troubled her is the typhoon. When the typhoon came, everything is terrible. It kept blowing
    and raining for a long time. And what made the situation worse was that all of Kitty's walls were made of wood.
    One day, Kitty found that there was a crack in the wall. The shape of the crack is a rectangle with the size
    of 1√óL (in inch). Luckly Kitty got N blocks and a saw from her neighbors. The shape of the blocks were rectangle too,
    and the width of all blocks were 1 inch. So, with the help of saw, Kitty could cut down some of the blocks
    (of course she could use it directly without cutting) and put them in the crack, and the wall may be repaired
    perfectly, without any gap. Now, Kitty knew the size of each blocks, and wanted to use as fewer as possible of
    the blocks to repair the wall, could you help her ?

    ‚ñ† Input
    ‚Äì The problem contains many test cases ‚Äì Each test case contains two lines.
    ‚Äì In the first line, there are two integers ùêø(0 < ùêø < 1000000000)and ùëÅ(0 <= ùëÅ < 600)which mentioned above.
    ‚Äì In the second line, there are ùëÅ positive integers. The ùëñth integer ùê¥!(0 < ùê¥! < 1000000000)
      means that the ùëñth block has the size of 1√óùê¥! (in inch).

    ‚ñ† Output
    ‚Äì For each test case , print an integer which represents the minimal number of blocks are needed.
    ‚Äì If Kitty could not repair the wall, just print "impossible" instead.
