    ‚ñ† Longest Nice Substring

    ‚ñ† Description
    A string s is nice if, for every letter of the alphabet that s contains, it appears both in uppercase and
    lowercase. For example, "abABB" is nice because 'A' and 'a' appear, and 'B' and 'b' appear. However, "abA" is not
    because 'b' appears, but 'B' does not.

    ‚ñ† Input
    A string s

    ‚ñ† Output
    Return the longest substring of ùë† that is nice. If there are multiple, return the substring of the earliest
    occurrence. If there are none, return "none".
